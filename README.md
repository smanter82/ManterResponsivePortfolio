# ManterResponsivePortfolio
Sarah Manter's Responsive Portfolio 

Hello!  

I am currently taking a Coding Bootcamp Course in full-stack web development through UNH.  I have been a middle school English teacher for 13 years, but I have always been passionate about working with computers and am looking forward to a change of careers.  I am excited about the opportunity to use what I'm learning to turn ideas into usable products.

So far, I have learned to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery, and I am now familiar with using AJAX calls to work with data from third-party API's.
We are currently learning to work with Node.js, and I am looking forward to learning more about the back-end of web development.
